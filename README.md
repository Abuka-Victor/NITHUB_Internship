‭ 4. Hardware Engineer‬
‭ Scenario: You are building a smart home system that‬
‭ controls lights, temperature, and security using IoT‬
‭ devices.‬

● Task 1: Design and assemble a circuit using Arduino‬
‭ or Raspberry Pi to control an LED strip based on‬
‭ ambient light levels (use an LDR sensor).‬
ANS: The submission for this is in two files in this drive
1. Arduino_With_LDR_Video_Proof_Deployment.mp4
2. Arduino_With_LDR_TinkerCAD_Design.jpeg
The code is also contained in the GitHub repo in a file called “Arduino_With_LDR.ino” The link to the TinkerCAD design is found below

● Task 2: Develop a PCB design (using KiCad or Eagle)‬
‭ for a temperature sensor module that communicates‬
‭ with the central hub.‬
ANS: The submission for this is in two parts. There is a “Kicad Temperature Sensor” Folder that contains all the Kicad files for the project including the plots.
The plot and the picture of the 3d view is in the “Kicad Temperature Sensor” folder but it is also in the root folder of my submission.

● Task 3: Write firmware for an ESP32 to send sensor‬
‭ data (temperature, humidity) to a cloud server via‬
‭ MQTT.‬
ANS: The submission for this is in the GitHub repository in a file named “SensorDataFirmware.ino”. It is a sketch file. I do not have an ESP32 to test the code live so I just used the verify button to correct the errors that came up as I wrote the code.

● Task 4: Implement a security feature using a PIR‬
‭ motion sensor to trigger an alarm when motion is‬
‭ detected.‬
ANS: The submission code for this is in the GitHub repository in a file called “Security_Alarm.ino”. I don’t have the required sensors for this task so I have implemented a design in TinkerCAD, the link to the design is shown below but the screenshot of the design is in this drive in a file called “Arduino_With_PIR_TinkerCAD_Design.jpeg”.

● Task 5: Optimize power consumption for a‬
‭ battery-powered IoT device by implementing sleep‬
‭ modes.‬
ANS: The submission for this is also in the GitHub repository in a file called “BatteryOptimizerWithDeepSleep.ino”.
